# Travel Gallery Project

The idea of this project came to me after visiting Las Vegas, Nevada. for the first time. I wanted a digital portfolio
where I could share and showcase images and videos from my trips to different states. I plan to continue working on this
project and maybe one day I can showcase different countries!
